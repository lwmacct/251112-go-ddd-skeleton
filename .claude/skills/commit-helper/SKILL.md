# Generating Commit Messages

## Instructions

1. Use Chinese to write the message.
2. Run `git diff --staged` to see changes
3. I'll suggest a commit message with:
   - Summary under 50 characters
   - Detailed description
   - Affected components

## Best practices

- Use present tense
- Explain what and why, not how
